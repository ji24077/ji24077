Hi, I’m @ji24077.(ji sung Han)
👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and software engineering.

🌱 I’m currently learning computer science and statistics at the University of Toronto.

💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage machine learning in software development processes, such as automating code reviews, enhancing software testing through intelligent test case generation, and optimizing performance through predictive modeling.





📫 How to reach me: you can email me at yhs24077@gmail.com


⚡ Fun fact: I am Korean, and like to play chess.
